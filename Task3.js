/* Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd
You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:

The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.

The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.

The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number.

The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.

The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test1 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, this: test1 == 0.

The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is not equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.

Run console log two times after you've set the variables:

The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1

The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2

Note: The output to the console should be as follows:

Is 2 an even number? true

Is 5 an even number? false

Try it yourself with different values to explore the modulus operator. */

var num1 = 2;
var num2 = 5;
var test1 = (num1 % 2);
var test2 = (num2 % 2);
var result1 = (test1 === 0); 
var result2 = (test2 === 0); 
console.log("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);  
console.log("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2);

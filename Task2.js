/* Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, you’re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true". 

Try changing the timeRemaining variable to anything above 0 and then see how it affects the result. */


var timeRemaining = 0
var energy = 10
console.log("Game over: ", + timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0)
